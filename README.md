# Dynamic-Form
Dynamic Form UI Generation on basis of different users.

The project is about generating different form UI as per the user selection. That is through back end we select the input data that needs to be displayed and also which data such as for Select field or radio or checkbox. The whole moto of the project is to generate the form UI for different purpose and also according to the user need.

Example and Use case:
We have lots of festival in India, we want to generate the form to be filled by the users for different festivals and the fields that needs to be displayd will get decided by the BE as per the festival need. The back end api's contains all the required information that needed to generated for the form UI such as field name, placeholder, data for selecting fields and boolean values that it should be mandatory or not, etc.

We can generate the UI as per the need just by posting the data(api) for the  fields that we want.
